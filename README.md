Issue a token on the Xahau testnet network using Node.js. 

Use Node.js and VisualStudioCode to set up the project (or any similar tool that has a terminal integrated).

Step by step guide to use the code:

1) Create an empty folder in your desktop and name it as you like.

2) Download the js file I have in this project and put it in that folder: issueTokenXahauTestnetSimple.js

3) Open that folder with VSC, or when you are in VSC open the folder.

4) Open a terminal and type (it creates a basic package.json): npm init --yes

5) Then type in the terminal (it installs the library): npm install --save xrpl

6) Populate the code with your testnet seeds (not the ones that I have as example in it) and the name of the currency to issue.

7) Type in the terminal: node issueTokenXahauTestnetSimple.js
